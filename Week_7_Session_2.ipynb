    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this session, you will:\n",
    "1. Trace function calling with Langfuse for full visibility\n",
    "2. Build a traced Streamlit chatbot with tools\n",
    "3. Debug AI behavior by examining traces\n",
    "4. Understand how to monitor production applications\n",
    "5. Use traces to improve AI reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Completed Week 7 Session 1 (Langfuse basics)\n",
    "- Week 5 knowledge (function calling)\n",
    "- Week 6 knowledge (Streamlit)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Session 1**: You learned to trace simple functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Session 2**: Now trace REAL applications!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Debugging Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 1**: \"My AI chatbot called the wrong tool!\"\n",
    "- ❌ Without tracing: Guess why it happened\n",
    "- ✅ With tracing: See exactly what the AI received and why it chose that tool\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 2**: \"Function calling works in notebook but fails in Streamlit!\"\n",
    "- ❌ Without tracing: Add print statements everywhere\n",
    "- ✅ With tracing: Compare traces from both environments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 3**: \"AI sometimes gives wrong calculations!\"\n",
    "- ❌ Without tracing: Cannot reproduce the issue\n",
    "- ✅ With tracing: See the exact tool calls and parameters\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What You Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function calling is traceable**\n",
    "   - Every tool call is logged\n",
    "   - See parameters and return values\n",
    "   - Understand AI's decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multi-turn conversations need structure**\n",
    "   - Each turn = separate trace\n",
    "   - Parent trace groups the session\n",
    "   - Track context across turns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Streamlit apps benefit from tracing**\n",
    "   - Debug production issues\n",
    "   - See what users actually did\n",
    "   - Reproduce problems easily\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Metadata is critical**\n",
    "   - Tag with user_id\n",
    "   - Tag with environment\n",
    "   - Add version info\n",
    "   - Enable filtering and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Errors are traced too**\n",
    "   - Failed tool calls are visible\n",
    "   - Exceptions are logged\n",
    "   - Debug faster\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Production Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "When deploying traced apps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Add `@observe()` to all AI functions\n",
    "- ✅ Add `@observe()` to all tool functions\n",
    "- ✅ Include user_id in traces\n",
    "- ✅ Tag with environment (dev/staging/prod)\n",
    "- ✅ Add version info in metadata\n",
    "- ✅ Set up error handling\n",
    "- ✅ Test trace visibility in dashboard\n",
    "- ✅ Set up alerts for errors (Langfuse feature)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can:\n",
    "- Build traced applications confidently\n",
    "- Debug AI behavior systematically\n",
    "- Monitor production apps\n",
    "- Compare different approaches\n",
    "- Improve AI reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Langfuse Dashboard**: [https://cloud.langfuse.com](https://cloud.langfuse.com)\n",
    "- **Documentation**: [https://langfuse.com/docs](https://langfuse.com/docs)\n",
